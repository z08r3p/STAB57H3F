STAB57H3F:   An   Introduction to   Statistics 
Winter   2025   (last   updated   on   Jan   04,   2025) 
1 Course Description Mathematical   treatment   of   the   theory   of   statistics.      The   topics   covered   include:    the   statisti-   cal   model,   data   collection,   descriptive   statistics,   estimation,   conﬁdence   intervals   and   P-values,   likelihood   inference   methods,   distribution-free   methods,   bootstrapping,   Bayesian   methods,   re-   lationship   among   variables,   contingency   tables,   regression,   ANOVA,   logistic   regression,   appli-   cations.      Statistical   software   R   will   be   used.Contents,   emphasis,   etc.    of   the   course   is   deﬁned   by   means   of   the   lecture   materials   -   not   only   the   texts.   Table   1 shows the tentative lecture guide.    Lecture slides   will   be   uploaded   every   week.   However, they are just rough, point-form   notes, with   no   guarantee   of   completeness   or   accuracy.   They   should   in   no   way   be   regarded   as   a   substitute   for   attending   the   lectures,   or   for   doing   the   weekly   non-credit   homework.
Important   announcements,   problem   sets,      additional   examples,      and   other   course   info   will   be   posted   on   the   course   web   page   on   Quercus.      Check   it   regularly.

4 Homework Every   week   after   the   lecture   a   set   of   exercises   will   be   provided.         This   homework   is not for credit.    This   is   only   meant   to   give   students   opportunities   to   learn   the   materials   and   prepare   themselves   for the tests   and exam.    TAs will   solve   some   of the   harder problems   i代 写STAB57H3F: An Introduction to Statistics Winter 2025R

5 Tutorials The   tutorials   will   start   on   the   second   week      and   run   until   the   last   week   of   class.       Tutorials   will   cover   topics   taught   in   the   previous   week’s   lecture.      In   preparation   for   the   tutorials,   you   should   do   weekly   non-credit   homeworks.    There   will   be   short quizzes every week starting from week 3 based   on   previous   week’s   lectures   and   non-credit   homeworks.   You   have   to   write   the   quizzes   in   your   assigned   tutorial.    Quizzes   are   open-book   (students   are   also   allowed   to   use   lecture   notes).    Default   score   for   a   missed   quiz   is   zero.    Out   of   the    10   quiz   scores,   your   best   5   scores will be worth 5% of the course grade.    Quiz marks cannot be shifted to other assessments.
6 Assignments for credit There will be two assignments   (each worth   10%) in the course.   Both the assignments   are take   home and will require some hand calculations and some coding in R. The tentative assignment   release   dates   are   :   mid-February   and   mid-March.    Students   will   be   given   reasonable   time   to   ﬁnish each of the assignments.   Clear instructions will be given on how to complete and submit   your work.   Crowdmark will be used for all the assessments in   the   course.
7 Evaluation 
• Midterm test: outside of lecture hours, will be scheduled by the office of registrar.
• Final exam: everyone registered in the course will   be   required   to   write   the   exam,   will   cover everything taught in the course, date and time will be ﬁxed by the   office   of   registrar   and will be announced   later.
Grades will be calculated using two schemes.   The ﬁnal course grade will be the larger of the two grades.

There are NO make-up assessments of any   form   in this   course.
•   Taking the   ﬁnal   exam   and   submitting   both the   assignments   are mandatory for   every   student in order to pass   this   course.
•    Students are not required to submit any doctor’s note   for   missing   the   midterm.
9 Computing Statistical software R will be used extensively.   Students will learn solving probability problems   using simulations in R. No previous   exposure   is   expected   and R will be introduced starting from   the basics.   Any code used in the lectures will be available on the course web-page   for   students   to practice at their own   time.
